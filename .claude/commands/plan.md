Read @CLAUDE.md and @SPEC.md (if it exists). Create a detailed implementation plan. Break the project into phases, where each phase is 1-2 weeks of work. Within each phase, break tasks into units that can each be completed in a single Claude Code session. Each task should list specific files to create/modify and have clear acceptance criteria. Save to PLAN.md. Do not write any code.
